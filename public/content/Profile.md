## About
My name is Pedro Baldaia, I'm a student and I've already taken the computer networks and systems course. Right now, I'm focused on finishing another degree (technology and information systems for the web) where I fit in a lot and do what I really like. To bring you up to date, this degree is based on a multidisciplinary vision of the web, adding skills in the conception, design and development of products and software for the Web. It allows us to explore skills and gain knowledge in cloud services, mobile and ubiquitous computing, web platforms, and not forgetting ergonomics, interaction design, usability, user experience or prototyping.During this year I launched Webcreaterpt, where you can find examples of my work on Facebook or instagram, I know I'm at an embryonic stage, but we have to start somewhere. I launched this project with the main objective of providing the service of creating websites, more specifically e-commerce stores and to be honest, making some extra money. As you know, we live in difficult times where we have to adapt to reality with what it offers us.
